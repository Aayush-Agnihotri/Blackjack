  Our project is Blackjack with altered functionality. Instead of everyone being 
  dealt one card to begin with, the dealer goes one by one to each player and asks
  them if they want to hit or stay. Based on the past players' decisions and results,
  the CPUs that we have built will change their decisions on whether to hit or stay.
